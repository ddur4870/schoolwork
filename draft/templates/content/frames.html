	What is this? A software framework or library provides a layer of abstraction for the programmer. This means that predefined functions are readily available for the user to use. This makes the use of JavaScript to be a much more enjoyable, easier and smoother experience; enabling the programmer to focus on the major task at hand, and not the minimal, smaller problems.
